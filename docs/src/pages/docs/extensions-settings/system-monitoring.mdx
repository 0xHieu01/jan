## System Monitor
The System Monitor extension now offers enhanced customization for app logging. Users can toggle the application logging feature on or off and set a custom interval for clearing the app logs. To configure the app log feature, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click the **Gear Icon (⚙️)** on the bottom left of your screen.
3. Under the **Core Extensions** section, select the **System Monitoring** extension.
4. Use the **slider** to turn the app logging feature on or off.
5. Specify the log cleaning interval in milliseconds.

<Callout type='info'>
  - You can clear the app logs manually by clicking the **Clear logs** button in the advanced settings.
  - There are no minimum or maximum intervals for setting the time. However, invalid inputs will default to `120000ms (2 minutes)`.
